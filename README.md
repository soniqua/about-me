This is my user manual.

### Conditions I Like to Work In

- I tend to listen to music when I work! This doesn't mean I can't be interrupted - this is the norm, I might just be slow to respond.
- I struggle when I don't have my own personal space/desk setup.
- I like to have my room on the colder side.

### Best Ways to Communicate

- Slack, or GitHub! Anything else is likely to get lost in the noise.
- I prefer requests to go to public Slack channels that I can be tagged in.
- If you send me a slack message, include your request! [https://nohello.net/en](https://nohello.net/en).
- I try to respond to urgent messages quickly - if I "leave you on read" I'll get to you when I next have space.
- I need context! I'll normally try to understand a situation before offering my own input.

### How I Best Receive Feedback

- I really like feedback to be actionable and specific. This can be written or verbal - I don't mind the medium.
- I prefer to discuss feedback in a private setting, but am happy to talk about it wider afterwards.

### Things I Need

- Good coffee.
- Fast internet.

### How I Learn Best

- I learn through experimentation - I tend to re-create or try written/verbal learning practically before it sticks.
- I enjoy learning from others, and enjoy problem solving together.

### Things I Struggle With

- If I miss context or don't have sufficient background I tend to feel removed/not involved in a discussion.
- I am less productive when I'm not using my home setup.
- I can get "sucked in" to work and struggle to detach - please try to involve me in more social opportunities (pairing, etc.).
- I can find abstract problems hard to engage with - there needs to be a practical application.

### Things That Annoy Me

- "Streams of consciousness" on Slack.
- Meetings without agendas.
- Closed opinions.

### Things I Love

- I love problem solving - this could be anything from a small technical feature to an incident. I might crash the party.
- I love making things more efficient, or removing toil.

### Other Things To Know About Me

- If you already know something that I'm speaking about, please interrupt me!
- I tend to use humour and levity to defuse situations that could be stressful.
